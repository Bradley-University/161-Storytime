# 161-Storytime
Your lab for tonight's class is to start a story: 

Pull the latest copy of the repo: 
See the prompt at the top of the page 

The first person will start the story off, each person after will pull the latest copy of the repo first, then add their paragraph. 

To make things easier for me, Please add your name at the end of your paragraph. 

Please consider adding images and styles within the page to make it look amazing!
