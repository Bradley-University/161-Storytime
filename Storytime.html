			We open on a lone house in the middle of the countryside, with nothing but the lone two-story building with flaking paint off the side of the house. 
			With the closest civilization being the convenience store a mile or so away, young Isaac has had a pretty boring life to this point. 
			That is until he is startled awake early in the morning by the sound of a large "BOOM!" from his backyard! - Caden Sheahan
		</p>
        <p>
			The explosion shook his house- taking off what little paint was left. His ears still ringing, Isaac peered out his window to find a crater in his backyard. 
			A large stone sitting in the middle of the rubble. Clearly some kind of meteor had struck- but from where? - Andrew Czarnik
		</p>
		<p>
			Unsure how to proceed, Isaac slowly crept downstairs, wanting to get a closer look at this meteor. As he stepped outside, he noticed that it began to glow. 
			Isaac froze place, transfixed by the meteor. - Alex Chartrand
		</p>
		<p>
			He couldn't help but start to widen his eyes as he heard it-- This low, electical hum. <em>VMM.. VMMM...</em>. His eyes widened in a mix of horror, and sheer
			amusement as he watched shades of blue start to pulsate over the rock.. Flaring to life over it's surface like alien veins. - Isabella Wilson
		</p>
		<p>
			Suddenly, the rock erupted, oozing molton blue liquid. He sprang away, narrowly avoiding a gruesome death. He stared in amazement at the being that had 
			hatched, a small, vaguely humanoid creature. Immediately, it began to emit a deafening, high-pitched wail, causing him to cover his ears. After some time, the 
			noise died down, and the... thing seemed to calm itself. - Diego Hudelson
		</p>
	    	<p>
			He approached it cautiously. The little creature began to suck on its own.. hand? paw? with a content hum. It turned its large black eyes to Isaac and smiled, revealing 
			rows of teeth that looked too sharp for its soft demeanor. "What are you, little guy?" Isaac wondered aloud. -Lee Lard
	    	</p>	
		<p>
			before Isaac could say anything outloud the create jumped onto him covering his face! Isaac Ran around frantically unable to get this thing off of his face. out of the smothered
			view he could almost see something else falling, it looked like some kinda of ship. barelying being able to yell he muttered out "get this thing off of me!" - Aidan O'Donnell
		</p>
        	<p>	After some time wrestling and screaming on the ground, Isaac finally got the creature off of his face. He barely had time to catch his breath when realized that there was in fact a 
			giant ship, that was about to fall right on him. He moved out of the way just in time as the ship crashed in his yard. There was a large thud
			as the door opened and a light appear from inside. -Emily Nelson
	    </p>
        <p>A white fog poured out of the ship, metal hatch slamming onto the broken earth. A small droid-like object whirred around a strange creature - tall with green skin and strange... Google glasses? "Woah guys, that was CRAZY! joryan38 thanks for the bits!" He waved at the small droid. "Okay guys, this is wild. I think this is called, "Earth?"" - Sophia Coulter</p>
